description:

There are n servers numbered from 0 to n-1 connected by undirected server-to-server connections forming a network where connections[i] = [a, b] represents a connection between servers a and b. Any server can reach any other server directly or indirectly through the network.
A critical connection is a connection that, if removed, will make some server unable to reach some other server.
Return all critical connections in the network in any order.

example:
Input: n = 4, connections = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,0],[1,3]]
Output: [[1,3]]
Explanation: [[3,1]] is also accepted.

thoughts:
We should use tarjan algorithm, using a global time variable to remember the path we went through to get to current node; 
it is stored in the dnf array for each node. The low array stores the the lowest node (earliest node) we can access to 
without visiting the parent node. if low[child] > dnf[parent] then we can not get rid of the edge parent -> child, because 
the lowest node we can access to without going through parent node comes after parent node.
